        Welcome Dinner
      %p.minimal
        It’s fiesta time in Waterfront Park, as we welcome all our guests to Hood River for our wedding weekend. Watch the windsurfers and kite boarders, play some soccer or frisbee, and kick back with some tasty Mexican food and drinks (we’ll provide!). The park can be windy. It’s good for flying kites, but you better bring a jacket. The welcome dinner goes from 5:00 PM to sunset, so stop by anytime. Ay, ay, ay, we are so glad you’ve made it to celebrate with us!

        Wedding Ceremony and Reception
      %p.minimal
        Here’s the important part - ceremony and vows, dinner, drinks, and dancing! Our ceremony and reception will take place at Clarke Mountain Estate in Parkdale, a 30 minute drive from downtown Hood River. The property has plenty of parking, but we will provide shuttles from downtown Hood River as well, starting at 3PM. The ceremony will begin at 4:30 PM. The dress code is semi-formal - the ceremony and reception are outside, so you might want to bring a jacket in case the wind picks up. The party will continue late into the night and then we’ll return to Hood River (shuttles will be available) for the after party!

        %p
          Officiant: Steve Reed (Katie’s uncle)
          %br
          Bridesmaid: Emily Sharp (Katie’s friend since kindergarten)

        Farewell Picnic
      %p.minimal
        Come by Jackson Park in Hood River to say goodbye to the newlyweds before you leave town. We’ll bring any leftover food and booze from the weekend. Bring your own favorite picnic fare and relax the afternoon away. Or just stop by to say adieu. We’re so glad you could join us to celebrate our marriage!

        Lodging
      %p
        Hood River during the summer is 
        %i very
        popular! Many of the hotels are already completely booked. This means that it would be best to book housing 
        %span.important
          as soon as possible.
        Some of the hotels do periodically release new rooms to be rented, so it can be worth calling hotels that previously said they were all booked up. 
      %p
        Most homes for rent require a four (or more) night minimum during the summer. If you can stay that long, we think you'll find plenty to do! We have reserved some shuttles to help guests from downtown Hood River to the wedding venue.

        Downtown Hood River has a number of great restaurants, shops, wineries, and breweries. If you venture a bit further out of town, you can find plenty more fun things to do - world-class wind surfing and kite boarding, mountain biking, hiking, and a beautiful drive through the fruit orchards, to name just a few.

      How We Met
    %p
      They met at Starbucks, much to Katie's chagrin.
    %p
      It's the classic "we met at a wedding" story, but really, they should have met sooner. They had been at a few of the same events without ever meeting - for example, a dragon boat racing festival in Vancouver B.C. They finally met at Brent (Evan's childhood friend and Katie's cousin) and Julia's wedding in Monterey in 2012.
    %p
      The wedding was on a Friday, and they both needed to work in the morning. Separately, they headed to the Starbucks near the hotel for the free wifi. As he passed by her table, Katie recognized Evan from the party the night before and he sat down next to her. They hit it off, and needless to say, not much work was done that morning.
    
    %p
      At the reception that night, Brent's dad was playing matchmaker. "Evan, she is so smart." "Katie, there's only one guy in here for you." And so on. By the end of the night, Katie was inviting Evan into the hot tub with her for a late night soak. He said no. Prude! 
      
    %p
      However, Evan was working the long play. He bought a plane ticket up to Portland two weeks later to see her. After a great weekend together, they were smitten. Flash forward a year of long distance dating. Katie moved down to San Francisco, and the couple moved in to a cute apartment in Noe Valley.

      In October 2014, Evan popped the question. It was a very creative proposal. Evan channeled Katie's family's craftiness and gave Katie a series of four handmade gifts over the course of six weeks. After he gave her the last one, he asked if she had solved the puzzle. "What puzzle?" It turned out, each gift represented a word in that age-old question. After a hint or two, Katie put all the pieces together, and Evan voiced the words: "Wheel ewe Mary me?"
